/**
 * Unique Paths
 *
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

 The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

 How many possible unique paths are there?


 Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

 Note: m and n will be at most 100.

 Example 1:

 Input: m = 3, n = 2
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 1. Right -> Right -> Down
 2. Right -> Down -> Right
 3. Down -> Right -> Right
 Example 2:

 Input: m = 7, n = 3
 Output: 28

public class UniquePaths {
  public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {

      return 0;
    }

    int[][] dp = new int[m][n];

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (i == 0 && j == 0) {
          dp[i][j] = 1;
        } else if (i == 0) {
          dp[i][j] = 1;
        } else if (j == 0) {
          dp[i][j] = 1;
        } else {
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        }
      }
    }

    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
  }
}
